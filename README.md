## Description

This is a README file for the portfolio project created by Janzen Forrest Dela Cruz. This project serves as a personal portfolio website to showcase your skills, projects, and information to potential employers, clients, or anyone interested in your work as a full-stack developer.

The portfolio website is built using Vue.js, Tailwind CSS, and other web technologies to create a responsive and visually appealing user interface. It includes sections for your home, skills, projects, and an about me page.

## Features

- **Navigation:** The website has a navigation menu that allows users to easily navigate to different sections of the portfolio by clicking on the menu items.

- **Responsive Design:** The website is designed to be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes, making it accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.

- **Skills Section:** A dedicated section to showcase your skills, including programming languages, databases, frameworks, and tools you are proficient in.

- **Projects Section:** Display your projects with project titles, descriptions, and links to live demos and GitHub repositories.

- **About Me Section:** Share information about yourself, your background, and your journey as a developer. You can also include a personal image to add a personal touch.

- **Contact:** Provide contact information such as your email address for potential clients or collaborators to reach out to you.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/JanzenDC/vue-Portfolio-Ui.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd portfolio-project
   ```

3. Install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Customize the content:

   - Replace placeholder images with your own images in the `src/images` directory.
   - Update the text content in the Vue template to reflect your skills, projects, and about me information.

5. Customize the navigation links in the template to link to the appropriate sections on your website.

6. Customize the contact information in the footer section.

7. Build and run the project locally:
